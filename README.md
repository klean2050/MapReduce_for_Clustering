# MapReduce for k-means Clustering

This repository contains a programming assignment in Python for the ECE NTUA Course on Advanced Database Systems. A dataset with 13.000.000 recordings of taxi routes in New York is used in order to perform k-means clustering. The distributed program is run with Spark on the distributed Filesystem HDFS. Results are written in .csv format.
